# tic-tac-toc
###This is a tic-tac-toc game against the computer
>This is my first try, please ignore the mess codes.


I'm sorry, there are `lots of` `magic numbers`, :joy:

I'll make the code easier to read in the next version.

###note:
You can simply compile main.cpp in terminal

* `$ g++ main.cpp -o ticgame` 
* `$ ./ticgame`

###how to play
* The computer take the first step.
* o :computer
* x :you
* just type the number of block you want to take
